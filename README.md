# PRedatOr2
This is my solution to the practical part of the course called PRO2,
that was taught at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de
Catalunya](http://upc.edu) during the Fall semester of 2012-2013.

As you can see, there are 4 different classes, and modularity (the most
important requirement) has been respected. All the files contain
comments in the *DoxyGen* format. You can generate the *html* and *pdf*
documentation by running *DoxyGen* in the project directory.
